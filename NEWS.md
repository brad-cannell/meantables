# meantables 0.1.2

* Added the `mean_format()` function.

# meantables 0.1.1

* Changed the way that `n_miss` and `n` are calculated. Now correct when there are missing values. Built unit test to check for this.

* Changed the `x` argument of `mean_table()` to `.x`. This prevents an error when passing a variable named `x` to `mean_table()`.

* Added standard deviation to `mean_table()` results.

# meantables 0.1.0

* First release on CRAN
