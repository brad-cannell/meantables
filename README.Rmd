[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/meantables)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=meantables)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of meantables is to quickly make tables of descriptive statistics (i.e., counts, means, confidence intervals) for continuous variables. This package is designed to work in a Tidyverse pipeline, and consideration has been given to get results from R to 'Microsoft Word' Â® with minimal pain.

## Installation

You can install the released version of meantables from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("meantables")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brad-cannell/meantables")
```
## Example

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(meantables)
```

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

### Overall mean table with defaults

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mean_table(mpg)
```

### Formatting overall mean and 95% CI

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  mean_table(mpg) %>%
  mean_format(
    recipe = "mean (lcl - ucl)",
    name = "mean_95",
    digits = 1
  ) %>% 
  select(response_var, mean_95)
```

### Formatting grouped means table with mean and sd

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  mean_table(mpg) %>%
  mean_format("mean (sd)") %>% 
  select(response_var:group_cat, formatted_stats)
```

### Grouped means table with defaults

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  mean_table(mpg)
```
